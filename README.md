# MKS-H3615NS
# Feature
* Extremely small size, only 5.5cm×5.5cm
* Support motor voltage 9-36V, under voltage protection
* Maximum continuous load current 12A (without heat sink), 15A (simple heat sink), 20A (thick large heat sink)
* Similar to the L298N drive logic, support three-wire control enable, forward,reverse and brake.
* Support full PWM, you can directly use the buttons to control the forward and reverse rotation, the effective range of PWM is 0.1%~100.0%
* Can provide 5V power for the mircocontrollers and other controllers
* Interface ESD protection
